# Cryptocurrency Dashboard

This project is a cryptocurrency dashboard that displays real-time cryptocurrency data using a React frontend and a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database. The data is fetched from the WazirX API and is updated every 60 seconds.

## Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency data fetching from WazirX API.
- Data updated every 60 seconds.
- Countdown timer indicating the next data update.
- Data stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- Simple and clean user interface built with React.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

    - Navigate to the `server` directory:

      ```sh
      cd server
      ```

    - Install backend dependencies:

      ```sh
      npm install
      ```

    - Set up PostgreSQL database:

      - Make sure PostgreSQL is running.
      - Create a new database (e.g., `crypto_dashboard`).
      - Update the database configuration in `server.js`:

        ```javascript
        const pool = new Pool({
          user: 'your_username',
          host: 'localhost',
          database: 'crypto_dashboard',
          password: 'your_password',
          port: 5432,
        });
        ```

    - Start the backend server:

      ```sh
      node server.js
      ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:

    - Navigate to the `client` directory:

      ```sh
      cd ../client
      ```

    - Install frontend dependencies:

      ```sh
      npm install
      ```

    - Start the frontend development server:

      ```sh
      npm start
      ```

    - The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Structure

```
/client               # React frontend
    /src              # Source files
